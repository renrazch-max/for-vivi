      Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. 💕 <br><br>
      Thank you for staying by my side until today.  
      Having you in my life means more than I can ever explain. <br><br>
      I pray that you are always healthy, happy,  
      surrounded by good things, and that every dream you have  
      comes true. <br><br>
      I’ll always wish the very best for you. 💗
